# bioinfo-term-project

## Goal

This repository is a result of final term project held in 2021-1 SNU bioinfo 1 class. The goal of this term project is to practice RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and CLIP-seq analysis.


## Missions
+ Mission 1
    + Draw a scatter plot which shows correlation between ribosome density change upon _Lin28a_ knockdown and LIN28A CLIP enrichment.
    + Show protein localizations with different colors.
    
+ Mission 2


+ Mission 3
